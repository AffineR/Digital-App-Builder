# Overview
{: #overview }
IBM Digital App Builder helps you to quickly create mobile, web, and PWA (Progressive Web App) multi-channel applications with AI capabilities powered by Watson services. The apps created using the Digital App Builder leverage IBM Mobile Foundation (Mobile Foundation service on IBM Cloud, or Mobile Foundation v8 on ICP) for security, backend connectivity, operational metrics and crash analytics.

The key features of the IBM Digital App Builder are as follows:

* Developers can use this tool to quickly build digital apps that can run on multiple channels. The Digital App Builder provides the ability to drag-and-drop components to quickly build an app. This app can be targeted to multiple channels, like apps for iOS (IPhone, iPad), Android (Phone, Tabs), Progressive web apps (PWA), and web pages.

* Developers can easily integrate Watson AI capabilities like Chatbot and Visual Recognition. Adding a chatbot or visual recognition capabilities to the app becomes as easy as adding a control. Developers can easily train the AI service by adding a set of questions and answers or drag-and-drop a set of images to classify. There is no need for a data scientist to build a complex machine-learning model.

* Developers can also add data bound controls for microservice backends. A wizard can be used to import an Open API specification (Swagger) for a microservice. This helps to create a dataset for building a frontend for the service which is bound to a data-bound UI control in the app. Switch to code view for performing advanced coding on the app.

* Developers can add push notifications services as part of Engagements.

* An app owner can enable Analytics for the app. The app now sends data to the Mobile Foundation server. The analytics console provides Crash data, Page flows, and Operations in the form of dashboards.

The app created uses open source technologies like Cordova, Ionic, and Angular. You can preview the app for various form factors before it is deployed. You can also use the quick start templates to build your apps.
